/*

Since this is a page layout issue, make your CSS changes to the layout.css instead of nav.css.

Style the <main> element to be:

90% of the width of its parent element
center aligned to the body
the same background colour as the <body> element
Tip: Add some temporary tags like paragraphs or headings (e.g. <p> <h1> <h2>) into main to see 
how it flows and that it aligns well vertically. We recommend using one of these handy Lorem Ipsum 
generators if you're at a loss for words.
